# Seeding Disorder

intro:
"I'm Eris, goddess of chaos and confusion."
"The bigger the mess the more POINTS"

## Gameplay

You move around with wasd.
There are blocks, the more they are moved far from their starting pos,
the more points gained.
The player can dash.
When a point threshold is reached the level is complete.
Points may be gained by ramming stuff proportional to the force magn.
